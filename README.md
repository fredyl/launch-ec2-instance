Proposed Step-by-Step Solution
1. Fetch Enabled Views

Connect to the control table {env}.admin.vendornightlyfiles.
Query for all rows where enabled = True.
2. Generate Full Loads

For each enabled view:
Query historical data from 1/1/2022 to the last day of the previous month.
Use Year and Month columns for partitioning.
Format filenames to {tablename_YYYYMM}.txt.
3. Write to Target Directories

Based on the environment (Dev, UAT, Prod):
Dev/UAT: Write to /Volumes/{env}/silver/MonthlyFullLoads/{tablename}/{tablename_YYYYMM}.txt.
Prod: Write to /mnt/prod/silver/MonthlyFullLoads/{tablename}/{tablename_YYYYMM}.txt.
4. Purge Old Data

Retrieve and apply retention periods.
Delete files older than the retention threshold.
5. Parameterize Scheduling

Use a configuration file or environment variable to manage schedules (e.g., cron jobs or Airflow).
6. Logging and Validation

Log operations for monitoring.
Validate output formats.


Granting Vendor Permissions
For Dev/UAT:
Assign Azure Storage permissions for specific folders under /Volumes/{env}/silver/MonthlyFullLoads/.
Use role-based access (RBAC) to manage permissions.
For Prod:
Assign fine-grained permissions in ADLS.
Vendors can be assigned Storage Blob Data Reader roles for specific containers.
Use a shared access signature (SAS) for temporary access if needed.

Explanation of Changes
Processing XXDATE:
Extracted Year and Month using integer arithmetic.
Year: XXDATE / 10000
Month: (XXDATE % 10000) / 100
Directory Structure:
Ensured files are written to view_name/year/month/viewname.txt.
Example: slsah/2024/11/slsah.txt.
Retention Logic:
Dynamically checks year/month directories to ensure files older than the retention period are purged.
Output Location:
Dev/UAT: /Volumes/dev/silver/MonthlyFullLoads.
Prod: /mnt/prod/silver/MonthlyFullLoads.



Here's a step-by-step time frame over 9 days to complete the project:

Day 1: Requirement Analysis and Planning
Task:
Review project requirements in detail.
Identify key components: control table, data format, file naming convention, retention logic, and partitioning.
Define target environments (Dev, UAT, Prod).
Plan the directory structure and partitioning schema.
Deliverable:
A detailed project plan and directory structure template.
Day 2: Control Table Integration
Task:
Query the control table to fetch enabled views.
Validate the structure and availability of required metadata.
Test sample queries to ensure data integrity.
Deliverable:
Function/script to retrieve enabled views from the control table.
Day 3: Data Query and Partition Logic
Task:
Develop logic to query data for XXDATE >= 20220101.
Extract and validate Year and Month from XXDATE.
Partition data dynamically by Year and Month.
Deliverable:
A script to fetch and partition data by Year and Month.
Day 4: File Naming and Directory Creation
Task:
Define the file naming convention (viewname/year/month/viewname.txt).
Develop logic to create directories dynamically based on the environment.
Test directory creation in Dev/UAT environments.
Deliverable:
Script to create directory structure and generate partitioned filenames.
Day 5: Output File Writing
Task:
Write partitioned data to text files in the correct directory.
Ensure output matches the daily delta format.
Validate the file contents and naming convention.
Deliverable:
Script to write partitioned data to text files.
Day 6: Retention and Purging Logic
Task:
Develop retention logic to delete files older than the defined period.
Test purging on sample directories and files.
Verify that no unintended data is deleted.
Deliverable:
Retention policy script integrated into the main process.
Day 7: Environment-Specific Outputs
Task:
Parameterize the script to handle Dev, UAT, and Prod environments.
Ensure Dev/UAT files are written to /Volumes, and Prod files to /mnt/prod.
Test outputs in Dev and UAT environments.
Deliverable:
Fully functional script handling environment-specific paths.
Day 8: Vendor Permissions and Security
Task:
Assign access roles for Dev/UAT/Prod folders.
Test SAS token generation for vendor access.
Ensure data access is restricted to necessary folders.
Deliverable:
Documented steps and tested permissions for vendor access.
Day 9: Final Testing and Deployment
Task:
Perform end-to-end testing in Dev and UAT environments.
Validate outputs, retention, permissions, and error handling.
Prepare for production deployment.
Deliverable:
Complete, tested script ready for production deployment.
Documentation of the process and configuration.
