Pseudocode for API Data Processing and Moving Data from Bronze to Silver in Azure Databricks
Function to get API Response (lytx_get_repoonse_from_event_api)
Define a base URL depending on the API endpoint.
Send a GET request to the API with appropriate headers.
Check the status of the response:
If successful (status code 200), return JSON data.
If unsuccessful, raise an exception with the error message.
Process API Data and Save to Delta Table (process_api_data_to_delta)
Call the API function to retrieve data from a given endpoint.
Check if the data is a list or dictionary:
Convert it to a DataFrame.
Add two timestamp columns (insert_time and update_time) to the DataFrame.
Check if the table already exists:
If it does, perform an upsert (merge) to update matching records and insert new ones.
If it doesn’t, create a new Delta table with the data.
Process Data for Multiple Endpoints
For each endpoint in the endpoints list:
Construct a table name based on the endpoint.
Call the process_api_data_to_delta function to process and save data.
Handle errors gracefully and print error messages for failed endpoints.
Fetch Data for Specific Vehicles
Call the API to fetch vehicle IDs.
For each vehicle ID:
Call the API for detailed vehicle data.
Store this data in a list.
Convert the list to a DataFrame and add timestamp columns.
Upsert (merge) or create a new Delta table for vehicle data.
Paginate through Vehicles
Set up pagination to retrieve all vehicle data, checking each page for the 'vehicles' key.
Append each page's data to a list and continue until the last page.
Convert the list of vehicles into a DataFrame and follow the upsert/creation process.
Fetch Video Event Data within a Date Range
Set the start and end date for the last two years.
Use pagination to fetch video events, checking for the 'events' key.
Append event data for each page.
Convert the event data into a DataFrame and upsert or create the Delta table.
Data Flow Presentation Outline
Data Ingestion from API
Use the function to fetch raw data from the Lytx API.
Process this data and move it to the Bronze layer of Delta Lake in Azure Databricks.
Data Processing in Bronze Layer
Perform upserts (merges) on existing data or create new Delta tables when data doesn’t exist.
Bronze layer holds raw data fetched from the API.
Data Cleansing & Transformation
Add timestamps and perform necessary transformations.
Data is processed and readied for the next stage.
Move Data to Silver Layer
Refined data from the Bronze layer is filtered, cleansed, and processed.
Write the transformed data to the Silver layer in Delta Lake for further analysis.
